# OrderModule-DDD

This repo was created for the Domain Driven Design instance. An order module was used on the basis of the project and an example was created around this module.

## What is DDD

It is a software development approach that has emerged to ensure that ever-changing business rules are successfully applied to software projects in an orderly fashion.

With this approach, permanent solutions can be developed for the continuity of the software development stages or the live projects, and for the basic problems that are constantly experienced.

### Ubiquitous Language

Ubiquitous Language is the common language that enables communication between the software team and Domain Expert.

- Everything must have a definition: All definitions, terms and methodologies used within the domain should be clearly understandable.

- Details should be on the agenda: Attention should be paid to details and no open points should be left.

- The language used should be constantly improved.

- The examples used should be concrete.

- It should clearly explain the purpose of the domain.
